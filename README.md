E-commerce UI Components :

This task involves designing and implementing six essential UI components for e-commerce applications using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React, and JavaScript.

1. Product Card: Displays product details like image, title, price, and an "Add to Cart" button in an organized and responsive layout.

2. Product Filter Sidebar: Provides filters like categories, price range, and ratings, enabling users to refine product searches easily.

3. Shopping Cart Preview: Shows selected items with a quick overview of quantity, price, and a "Proceed to Checkout" button.

4. Wishlist Page: Displays a list of saved products with options to move them to the cart or remove them.

5. Checkout Form: A responsive form for entering shipping, payment, and billing details, ensuring a smooth checkout process.

6. Order Confirmation Modal: Displays a summary of the order with confirmation details after purchase.

Each component is built with responsiveness and user experience in mind, ensuring seamless functionality across devices.To provide a quick visual overview, I have also included screenshots of the web application, showcasing its layout and functionality.
